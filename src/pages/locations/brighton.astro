    If you didnt know, Brighton, NY, is home to the main campus of <a
      href="https://www.monroecc.edu/">Monroe Community College (MCC)</a
    >, the auxiliary campuses of <a href="https://sunyempire.edu/"
      >SUNY Empire State College</a
    >, <a href="https://www.medaille.edu/"></a> Medaille College, and the <a
      href="https://www.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a
    >. Needless to say, with all of these educational opportunities, Brighton is
    one intelligent place to live! Brighton was originally settled in about 1790
    and was formally established in 1814. It is one of the oldest towns in
    Monroe County. Until the 20th century, it was mainly a farming and
    brick-making community. It then began to evolve into the upscale suburban
    area it is today. <a href="https://summitexteriors.org/"></a> provides home improvement
    services to homeowners in Brighton and throughout the Greater Rochester area.
