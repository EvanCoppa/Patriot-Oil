# **Preparing Your Home for Winter: A Heating Oil Checklist**

Winter is just around the corner, and ensuring your home is ready for the cold is essential. For homes heated with oil, preparation can make all the difference in maintaining comfort and avoiding costly emergencies. Follow this heating oil checklist to keep your home warm and stress-free throughout the winter months.

## **1. Inspect Your Heating Oil Tank**

- **Check for Leaks:** Inspect your tank for any signs of leaks or rust that could lead to issues during the winter.
- **Clean Around the Tank:** Clear debris, snow, and ice from the area surrounding your tank to ensure safe and easy access for deliveries.
- **Check the Vent Pipe:** Ensure the vent pipe is clear of obstructions to maintain proper airflow.

## **2. Schedule a Delivery Early**

- **Plan Ahead:** Don’t wait until the first cold snap to order heating oil. Schedule your delivery early to avoid delays during peak season.
- **Set Up Automatic Delivery:** Consider enrolling in automatic delivery with Patriot Discount Oil to ensure your tank is always filled based on your usage patterns.

## **3. Test Your Heating System**

- **Turn It On Early:** Run your heating system before the cold weather sets in to ensure everything is working correctly.
- **Listen for Unusual Noises:** Strange noises could indicate an issue that needs professional attention.
- **Replace Filters:** Clean or replace your furnace filters to improve efficiency and indoor air quality.

## **4. Schedule a Furnace Maintenance Appointment**

- **Professional Tune-Up:** Regular maintenance ensures your heating system is running at peak performance and can help prevent breakdowns during the winter.
- **Tank Inspection:** Schedule a tank inspection to check for any structural issues or potential problems.

## **5. Monitor Your Heating Oil Levels**

- **Check the Gauge:** Keep an eye on your oil levels and plan for refills when your tank is around 25% full.
- **Track Your Usage:** Understanding your usage patterns can help you better plan deliveries and avoid running out of fuel.

## **6. Improve Your Home’s Insulation**

- **Seal Drafts:** Use weather stripping or caulk to seal windows and doors, reducing heat loss.
- **Add Insulation:** Ensure your attic and walls are properly insulated to maintain warmth and reduce heating costs.
- **Install a Programmable Thermostat:** Adjusting the temperature based on your schedule can save energy and reduce your heating bill.

## **7. Prepare for Emergencies**

- **Have a Backup Plan:** Keep a small space heater as a backup in case of system failures.
- **Emergency Contact:** Save Patriot Discount Oil’s emergency delivery number to ensure prompt service if you run out of heating oil.
