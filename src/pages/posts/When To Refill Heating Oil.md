# **When Should You Refill Your Heating Oil Tank?**

Knowing when to refill your heating oil tank is essential for maintaining a warm and comfortable home, especially during the cold winter months. Running out of heating oil can be stressful and potentially costly, but with proper planning, you can ensure uninterrupted heating all season long. Here’s what you need to know about timing your refills effectively.

## **1. Check Your Tank Regularly**

- **Gauge Levels:** Most heating oil tanks have a built-in gauge that displays the fuel level. It’s recommended to refill your tank when it reaches the 25% mark to avoid running low.
- **Visual Inspection:** If your tank lacks a gauge, use a measuring stick or consult your provider for assistance in checking the levels.

## **2. Consider Seasonal Usage**

Heating oil consumption tends to increase during colder months. Plan for more frequent refills between November and February when temperatures are lowest and heating demand is highest.

## **3. Monitor Your Usage Patterns**

- **Family Size and Habits:** Larger households or homes with high heating needs will require more frequent refills.
- **Home Insulation:** Poorly insulated homes use more heating oil. Consider improving insulation to reduce consumption.

## **4. Schedule Deliveries in Advance**

- **Avoid Emergency Refills:** Don’t wait until your tank is nearly empty to order heating oil. Emergency deliveries can be more expensive and less convenient.
- **Automatic Delivery:** Enroll in an automatic delivery program with Patriot Discount Oil to ensure timely refills based on your usage history.

## **5. Watch the Weather Forecast**

- **Cold Snaps:** Order ahead of expected cold fronts to avoid increased demand and delivery delays.
- **Severe Weather:** Refill your tank before snowstorms or other severe weather conditions to ensure your home remains heated.

## **6. Take Advantage of Off-Season Pricing**

- **Spring and Summer Refills:** Heating oil prices are often lower during warmer months. Refilling your tank during this time can save money and prepare you for winter.

## **7. Plan for Emergencies**

- **Backup Plan:** Keep Patriot Discount Oil’s emergency delivery contact information handy in case of unexpected shortages.
- **Tank Maintenance:** Regular inspections can prevent issues like clogged lines or leaks that may disrupt your heating supply.
