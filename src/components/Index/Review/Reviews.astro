      review="Amazing service!! My family ran out of Oil in the middle of the night, and could not find any oil company that was willing to deliver to us since we were not customers yet. Patriot oil was amazing over the phone and came out the same day. we will be loyal customers from now on.

      review="Been ordering from them since last winter and they easily have the best customer service out of the companies in my area. I had an emergency not too long ago and needed oil same day on a very cold day where they were extremely busy. They still were able to deliver a full tank for me within a few hours. Definitely recommend them 100%."

    review="We order oil from Gino at Patriot Discount Oil all the time and are very pleased with his prompt service, cheap prices, and heating oil! Not only is it great to get the cheapest price for oil in the state, but it feels great supporting small family owned local businesses.
Thank you!"
